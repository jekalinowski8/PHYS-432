  FCTS and Lax-Frederich advection solvers. Solves and plots the advection equation with initial conditions f(x)=x and u=-0.1, for fixed boundary conditions over a given time range.
  - problem2.py Advection-diffusion solver with Lax-Frederich method for advection and implicit method for diffusion. Solves and plots the advection-diffusion equation with intial conditions f(x)=x and u=-0.1, for fixed boundary conditions over a given time range. Generates plots for two values of the diffusion coefficient.
